# `.dna/` Business Layer Convention

> The business layer is governed by the architect, strictly separated from the capability layer (`.claude/agents/`).
>
> **Canonical specification**: v1/docs/MODULE-MD-DESIGN.zh-CN.md. This file is the kernel-side convention reference.

## Core Concepts

**Module**: Any directory containing a `.dna/` subdirectory is a module.

**Module registry**: `.cbim/index.md` is the canonical, framework-managed list of all modules in the project. It is **required** (auto-created by `install.py`, auto-updated by `init_module`). `list_modules` / `snapshot` read it for speed; full filesystem scans are reserved for `reindex` / governance validation.

**Project-root module**: The project root MAY have its own `.dna/module.md`, making it the top of the tree. This is **optional**. Mixed monorepos / multi-system repos (e.g. v1 framework + v2 packages coexisting) typically skip it — having a project-root module would force a confusing "which system does this describe?" identity.

**Module tree**: Implicitly defined by the filesystem directory hierarchy. Parent module = the nearest ancestor directory that contains `.dna/`. No explicit hierarchy declaration is needed.

---

## Convention Layers

| Layer | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Hard constraint** | `.dna/` exists = module; `module.md` must exist inside `.dna/`; `.cbim/index.md` is the registry (must exist after install) |
| **Framework recommended** | `contract.md` (protocol boundary), `workflows/` (deterministic processes) |
| **User freedom** | Any custom files under `.dna/` |
| **Optional** | Project-root `.dna/module.md` — useful for single-application projects; skip in monorepos |

---

## Module Directory Structure

```
<project>/
└── <module>/
    └── .dna/
        ├── module.md              # required: the sole hard requirement
        ├── contract.md            # optional (recommended): protocol boundary (REST/gRPC/SDK)
        ├── workflows/             # optional (recommended): deterministic processes
        │   └── <workflow-name>/
        │       └── workflow.md
        └── <any user-defined files>  # optional: free extension
```

> **Change logs are not inside the module directory.** Module changelogs are written into session memory (`.cbim/memory/`); the architect periodically distills and promotes them back to `.dna/`.

**Framework-managed registry** (always at this fixed location, even when the project has no root module):

```
<project>/
└── .cbim/
    └── index.md    # canonical list of all module paths in the project
```

Note: `.cbim/` is the framework, not a business module — it has no `.dna/` and no `module.md`, and is excluded from module scans by `_SCAN_SKIP_DIRS`. The registry lives directly at `.cbim/index.md` (no redundant `.dna/` wrapper).

## `module.md` Format

YAML frontmatter (metadata) + markdown body (architecture). A single file replaces the former `module.json` + `architecture.md` combination.

### Frontmatter Fields

```yaml
---
name: core-agent                           # required: kebab-case module name
owner: architect                           # required: responsible agent id
description: Agent lifecycle subsystem     # optional: brief module description
keywords: [agent, lifecycle, permission]   # optional: keywords for search
dependencies:                              # optional: paths of other modules this module depends on
  - src/types
includeDirs: []                            # optional: additional directories to include in context
---
```

### Body: Architecture Content

The markdown body after the frontmatter contains the module's architecture documentation. It follows the same design guide as the former `architecture.md`.

**Purpose**: Read once, grasp the architect's design intent. Write what the code cannot tell you; skip what the code already shows.

---

## `module.md` Design Guide

### Leaf Module

A leaf module's `module.md` body contains three sections:

1. **Positioning** — One sentence: what this module is and why it exists.
2. **Class Diagram** — Mermaid `classDiagram` showing classes, interfaces, key method signatures, and relationships (inheritance / composition / dependency).
3. **Key Decisions** — The "why" behind design choices — information invisible in the code itself.

Example:

````markdown
---
name: event-bus
owner: architect
description: Decoupled, type-safe in-process event dispatch
keywords: [event, pub-sub, decoupling]
dependencies: []
---

## Positioning

Decoupled, type-safe in-process event dispatch for cross-module communication.

## Class Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class IEventBus {
        <<interface>>
        +on(event: string, handler: EventHandler) Disposable
        +emit(event: string, payload?: unknown) void
    }

    class EventBus {
        -handlers: Map~string, Set~EventHandler~~
        +on(event, handler) Disposable
        +emit(event, payload?) void
        -ensureSlot(event) Set~EventHandler~
    }

    class Disposable {
        <<interface>>
        +dispose() void
    }

    IEventBus <|.. EventBus : implements
    EventBus ..> Disposable : returns
```

## Key Decisions

- **Interface-first**: Consumers depend on `IEventBus`, never on `EventBus` directly, enabling test doubles without mocking frameworks.
- **Disposable return**: `on()` returns a `Disposable` instead of requiring `off()`, preventing forgotten-unsubscribe memory leaks.
- **No async emit**: Handlers are synchronous by design; async side-effects should be managed by the handler itself, keeping the bus simple and predictable.
````

### Parent Module

A parent module's `module.md` body contains three sections:

1. **Positioning** — One sentence: what this module is and why it exists.
2. **Class Diagram** — Mermaid `classDiagram` with `<<module>>` stereotype per sub-module node. Each class node represents one sub-module; use `..>` association arrows for inter-sub-module dependencies. **Never write any child module's internal details.**

Example:

```
classDiagram
    class cache { <<module>> }
    class memory { <<module>> }
    class io { <<module>> }
    cache ..> memory : uses
    io ..> cache : configures
```

3. **Key Decisions** — Emergent insights visible only from the cross-child-module perspective: why these sub-modules exist together, how they interact at their boundaries.
   - **Decision smell**: if a bullet point is about a single sub-module's internal design ("Why X/ uses Y approach"), it belongs in *that sub-module's own* `.dna/module.md` — move it there.
   - **Component diagram implies sub-modules**: if you find yourself drawing boxes for internal components, those components must become separate CBIM modules with their own `.dna/` before this `module.md` is written.

---

## Key Decisions: Bounded, Current-State Only

Key Decisions are the **"why" of the current architecture** — each entry explains one structural choice that is visible in the class diagram but whose rationale the code cannot show (interface boundaries, sync vs async, dependency direction, a key data structure). Two properties follow from this:

- **Bounded by construction.** Decisions map one-to-one onto the module's *current* structural choices. A module has only so many such choices, so the decision count is small and does **not** grow with project age. `module.md` does not bloat.
- **Current state only — replace, never append.** When a decision is superseded, *remove* the old entry from `module.md` and let the new decision take its place. The old decision plus its time-bound rationale ("we chose X in 2024 because the team was small") drops into session memory — it must never accumulate in `module.md`. This is Business Hard Rule 1 ("No history") applied to decisions.

A Key Decision belongs in `module.md`, **not** in memory, because it is the *other half of the same knowledge unit*: the class diagram states WHAT the current shape is, the decision states WHY it is that shape. Split them and a reader sees the structure without the constraints behind it, and "improves" it into breakage. The **evolution** of a decision (how X became Y) is memory; the **current conclusion** is knowledge.

**Smell test for a Key Decision entry:**
- Explains why the *current* design is the way it is — timeless, no dates → keep it in `module.md`.
- Describes a change — "used to be X, now Y, because back then…" → that is history; it belongs in session memory, not here.

> Memory is short-term + medium-term only, and project-local. What is durable and network-shareable is **capability knowledge** (agents) and **business knowledge** (`module.md` / conventions) — not decisions. A decision is always a local, transient artifact; it never "graduates" into a cross-project asset.

---

## Optional: `contract.md` (Protocol Boundary)

| File | When to create | Constraint |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| `contract.md` | Cross-language / cross-process boundary (REST, gRPC, message protocol); publicly released SDK/library API contracts | Currently valid external interfaces only; no change history; high-density, interface signatures as primary content |

**Do NOT create `contract.md` for ordinary internal modules** (e.g., TypeScript modules consumed within the same codebase). In strongly-typed languages, the source code itself is the contract; duplicating it in `contract.md` adds maintenance burden with no value.

If `contract.md` does not exist for a module, no error is raised; this is the expected default.

---

## Module Change Workflow

Three scenarios, three paths:

### 1. New Module

```
Architect writes module.md (frontmatter + target-state class diagram)
  -> Programmer implements according to the diagram
  -> (Optional) Architect reviews implementation against blueprint
```

The architect produces the blueprint first. The class diagram represents the **target state** — what the module should look like when implementation is complete.

### 2. Incremental Change (behavior tweak, no structural change)

```
Programmer modifies code directly
  -> module.md is NOT updated (class diagram and structure unchanged)
  -> Change details go into session memory
```

If the change does not alter class/interface boundaries, method signatures, or relationships in the class diagram, the programmer can proceed without involving the architect. The `module.md` stays as-is.

### 3. Structural Refactor (interface/structure change)

```
Architect updates module.md (new class diagram + new Key Decisions)
  -> Programmer implements according to the new module.md
  -> (Large multi-step migration) Architect may create a temporary contract.md
    as a migration blueprint; delete it when migration is complete
```

Any change that alters the class diagram — new classes, changed interfaces, restructured relationships — requires the architect to update `module.md` first. For large-scale refactors requiring coordinated multi-step migration, `contract.md` may serve as a **temporary migration blueprint** and must be removed once the migration is complete.

---

## Business Hard Rules

1. **No history** — `module.md` and `contract.md` describe only the current final state. Never write what changed or why it changed. Changes go into session memory (`.cbim/memory/`); the architect periodically distills and promotes them. This applies to **Key Decisions** too: keep only the current rationale, replace (never append) when a decision is superseded, and let the old decision with its time-bound context fall into session memory. See *Key Decisions: Bounded, Current-State Only* above.

2. **Parent module writes only relationships and positioning** — A parent module's `module.md` body describes only: the relationships between child modules (dependency / composition / aggregation) and each child module's positioning. Never write any child module's internal details. Each child module's internal design is the responsibility of its own `module.md`. Any key decision that applies to a single child module belongs in that child's own `.dna/`, not in the parent.

3. **Capability and business separated** — The knowledge pack contains only project/module knowledge; it must not reference agent capability specs.

4. **Diagram syntax unified** — All three module types (leaf/parent/root) use `classDiagram`. No `graph TD` or `flowchart` for module diagrams. Leaf modules show code-level classes/interfaces; parent/root modules show sub-modules with `<<module>>` stereotype.

---

## Backward Compatibility

The engine supports dual-format loading:

- **New format (preferred)**: `.dna/module.md` with YAML frontmatter + markdown body
- **Legacy format (deprecated)**: `.dna/module.json` + `.dna/architecture.md`

When only the legacy format is found, the engine loads it with a deprecation warning. Existing legacy files in user projects are **not deleted** — migration timing is the user's decision.

---

## `index.md` Format (Root Module Only)

```markdown
# Module Index

- . (root module)
- src/combat
- src/inventory
- src/ui/hud
```

One module relative path per line. The architect updates this whenever a module is created or deprecated.

---

## Workflow Structure

```
.dna/workflows/<workflow-name>/
└── workflow.md     # trigger conditions + steps + output format
```

A workflow describes a **deterministic process within the module** — it contains no agent capability descriptions. Trigger conditions are explicit, steps are self-contained, and execution requires no additional human instructions.
