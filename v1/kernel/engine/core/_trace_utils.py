"""core/_trace_utils.py — Shared trace-emission helpers for BT nodes.

Extracted from ``core/runner.py`` so composite nodes (SwitchBranch, Selector,
etc.) can emit decision events into ``bb.trace`` without circular-importing
the Runner. The behavior is byte-identical to the original Runner-internal
helpers; only the home moved.

Both helpers are best-effort: they never raise into the caller, because
trace is observational and must not break a tick.

In debug mode (CBIM_DEBUG=1 or `.cbim/.debug` present), every event written
to ``bb.trace`` is *additionally* mirrored to the current session log under
the ``[BT]`` tag — same data, plain text, grep-friendly. This is purely
additive: the bb.trace / _trace_flushed_idx / trace.jsonl pipeline is
unchanged. The session-log write is best-effort and never propagates errors.
