"""core/node.py — Node ABC + Status three-state enum.

Design constraints (locked in .dna/contract.md + design README §2):
  - Node.tick(bb) -> Status is the ONLY entry; no business return values, only bb writes.
  - Status is closed at {SUCCESS, FAILURE, RUNNING} — no fourth state.
  - Nodes MUST NOT hold cross-tick state on `self`. tick-local variables are fine.
  - on_resume is optional; only Actions that yield need to implement it.
