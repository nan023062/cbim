"""dream/core/composite_tolerant.py — SequenceTolerant composite.

The governance loop's three steps (memory / knowledge / capability) are run
in strict order but must NOT short-circuit on a single-step FAILURE — one
broken step should not silently kill the rest. SequenceTolerant captures
this semantics:

  - tick children left-to-right
  - any RUNNING bubbles up immediately (the Runner yields, resume continues
    from the same child on next tick)
  - per-child final status (SUCCESS / FAILURE) is recorded into
    bb.step_results[child.name] before moving to the next child
  - after all children resolved:
      - at least one SUCCESS → composite returns SUCCESS
      - all FAILURE         → composite returns FAILURE

This is the design from `WORKFLOW-DREAM §三` SequenceTolerant section and the
architect's conflict-1 ruling: lives in dream/core because bt's Blackboard
schema does not carry `step_results` (a dream-only field).
