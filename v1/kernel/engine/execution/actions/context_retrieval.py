"""actions/context_retrieval.py — ContextRetrieval leaf.

Runs after InitTick and before ModeClassify on every tick. Calls
``engine.retrieval.search`` four times (one per source) with the user
request as query, then writes the three-bucket dict to
``bb.retrieved_context``:

    {
        "recent_memory":    [Hit, ...],   # transcript + memory_medium
                                          #   merged by score desc
        "agents":           [Hit, ...],   # agents source
        "module_knowledge": [Hit, ...],   # dna source
    }

Each Hit is serialized via ``Hit.to_dict()`` so the blackboard payload is
JSON-friendly (the snapshot writer round-trips it through ``json.dumps``).

Failure semantics (per .dna/contract.md "失败不阻塞 tick"): every
retrieval call is individually try/except'd; whatever didn't crash gets
written, the rest land empty. The node always returns SUCCESS. The
outer ``@Catch`` wrapper in the tree is a belt-and-suspenders guarantee
for any unexpected blowup outside the per-source try blocks.
