"""actions/flush_memory.py — drain bb.memory_flush_queue into memory.crud.

Wires the execution-root FlushMemory leaf to the memory CRUD sub-loop
(`engine.execution.loops.memory_crud.build_memory_crud_root`). For each
entry in `bb.memory_flush_queue` we run one CRUD tick with real service
callbacks (`memory.crud.primitives.write` + `FileBackend`). Successful
entries are removed from the queue; failures are swallowed individually
so one bad entry can't block the rest, and the whole node is also wrapped
in Catch(swallow) at the tree level — NEVER raises.

Entry shape (per execution README contract):
    {"path": "<absolute md path>", "tier": "short"|"medium", ...}

Backend wiring:
    Each tick builds its own FileBackend anchored at the project's
    `.cbim/memory/` (resolved via `context.cbim_dir()`). This mirrors
    `memory/_facade.py::_resolve_store_dir` so flush and read paths see
    the same store.
