"""DriftChecker — two-stage consistency verification.

fast (mtime+size): for entries whose meta.source_path exists, stat the
file and compare. Mismatches go into the drift list. Required to finish
sub-second for an architecture decision.

full (sha256): re-hash content for every meta entry. Slow path used by
the dream loop's MemRebuildIndex. Catches the same-mtime/same-size edge
case that fast misses, plus index-file corruption.

In Phase 1 the *repair* path here is intentionally minimal: drift items
without a known source_path are reported but not auto-fixed — repair
requires re-reading the original content which only the data-owning
module (memory.crud, hooks, etc.) knows how to do. When source_path *is*
recorded and the file is readable, we re-upsert (mtime/size/hash
refreshed); when the file is missing, we delete the doc.

The caller-facing repair contract: DriftReport.repaired / failed list
the doc_ids that were attempted; everything else is in drifted (caller
must arrange re-upsert through its own write path).
