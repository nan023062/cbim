"""
compaction/compactor.py — `compact()` orchestration.

The contract (compaction/.dna/module.md, status=spec):
- compact() runs independently of write — triggered by CLI / schedule / threshold.
- It reads candidates/ and writes results back through crud.primitives.update
  / .delete (compaction holds NO direct file-write permission on medium/).
- The candidates/ work area is exclusive to this module.

v2: short-tier responsibilities removed. The two candidate kinds that touched
short/ in v1 (`merge_short_into_medium`, `delete_short`) are gone — they were
the entire point of short→medium distillation, which has moved to the dream
loop's `memory_distill` skill. compact() in v2 is mostly a hatch for future
v2-native candidate kinds (promote-candidate review, medium-to-medium dedupe,
etc.); for now it just clears unknown candidates with a recorded error so the
work area doesn't accumulate stale stubs.

Iron rule: compact() itself is deterministic Python — NO LLM call here.
