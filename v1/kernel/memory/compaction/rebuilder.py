"""
compaction/rebuilder.py — `rebuild()` / `verify_retrieval_consistency()`.

v2: this replaces the v1 "rescan every tier dir and re-feed crud.write" path,
which existed to rebuild the in-process backend index. With the external
engine.retrieval index now the source of truth for cross-source search, the
rebuild action is two steps:

  1. Walk medium/ and re-call `crud.primitives.write` for each entry. This
     also re-fires the per-entry `engine.retrieval.index_upsert` sync, so a
     wholesale rebuild fixes drift on both the local backend index AND the
     external retrieval index.
  2. Call `engine.retrieval.verify_consistency("memory_medium", mode="full")`
     to surface anything step 1 couldn't reconcile (entries the retrieval
     index has but medium/ doesn't, etc.).

Step 1 is mostly a no-op on FileBackend (files ARE the local index) but
genuinely useful as a way to fan retrieval upserts for every medium entry.
Step 2 is the contractual side: a DriftReport callers can use to decide
whether further action is needed.
