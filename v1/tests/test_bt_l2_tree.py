"""L2 — tree topology / decorator stacking invariants (v3.6).

Static structural checks on the global ROOT to prevent silent topology drift.

Post-t? (5-mode): the root branch is now a SwitchBranch with five cases
(conversation / architect / hr / audit / execution). The three core-agent
branches each dispatch one core agent (architect / hr / auditor) and run
Respond on the result. v3.6 removed the HrExecution sub-loop: the execution
branch is now a straight Architect → Work pipeline; main agent maps
required_capability → agent_file via MCP agent_list at dispatch time.
